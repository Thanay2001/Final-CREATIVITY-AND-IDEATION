Response to Elliot's Silly Face 2-1 (module 9)

Your photo looks really cool and creepy in a good way. The red glass mask gives off a strong
horror feeling right away, and the way it warps the face underneath makes the image interesting
to stare at. It definitely matches the vibe of the horror movies you mentioned. The reflections in
the glass add a nice touch, too. Your explanation makes the image even better because it
connects the horror style to how you think about perception and identity. If you wanted to
explore this more, you could try different angles or lighting to show even more distortion or
contrast. But even as it is, the photo is eye-catching and has a clear message. Really strong
work.

Response to Elliot’s The Weight (module 5)

 I really liked your piece. It feels honest and emotional, and you did a great job showing how
complicated it can be to miss something you thought you wanted gone. The repeated idea of
“the weight” works really well because it shows how your feelings changed over time. Some
lines hit really hard, especially when you talk about missing parts of yourself and realizing both
versions of you deserve care. If you want to expand it, you could add a few more concrete
details so the reader can picture the moments more clearly. Maybe a memory, a sound, or
something physical that connects to the feeling. Your reflection was also strong, and you could
talk a little more about how writing the piece helped you understand yourself. But overall, it was
meaningful and powerful to read.

Response to Elliot’s Gender Troubles (module 8)

Your screenplay was straightforward to follow and had a clear vibe. The store setting felt real,
and Eli came across as a thoughtful, patient character. The interactions were natural, especially
the part with the kid. It was both funny and sweet. The ending line from the kid made the whole
scene feel lighter in a good way. If you want to push it further, you could show a little more of
what Eli is thinking or feeling during the tougher moments. Jess could also have a slightly bigger
part to show the support system more. You also have some cool contrasts in the environment
that you could lean into a bit more. But overall, it was heartfelt, realistic, and well done.




FAVORITE PIECE
My favorite piece out of the three was Elliot’s Silly Face (module 9). It stood out the most
because it was visually strong, creative, and meaningful. The combination of horror style and
identity made it memorable.
REFLECTION QUESTIONS

What was your general experience getting outside feedback?

Getting outside feedback felt helpful because it gave me perspectives I wouldn’t have thought of
on my own. It was nice seeing what people connected with and which parts stood out to
someone who wasn’t involved in the work. It helped me look at my own piece more openly.

Was there a specific note that really excited you and opened you up to a new way of looking at
your work?


Honestly, no. There wasn’t a specific note that completely changed how I viewed my work.
Everything was helpful to read, but nothing too crazy. The feedback was more generally
supportive rather than something that shifted my perspective in a major way.
