2) Deep Work — Rituals & Rules

Rituals
• Workspace Reset: clear desk, close all apps except what I need, water within reach.
• Pre Commitment Note + Lofi Playlist: write one line objective for the block, then play the same
playlist to cue focus.

Rules
• Phone out of the room; Do Not Disturb on.
• Single task rule: one app in full screen; email/social closed.

3) Mindfulness Exercises

Block 1 — Breathing Meditation (10 min): Box breathing at start of Tuesday study.
Block 2 — Beginner Yoga (20 min): Thursday evening sequence before study.
Block 3 — Walk (30 min): Friday evening walk without phone.

4) Reflection Responses

Block 1 — Breathing
The first two minutes felt noisy, but counting breaths calmed me. I transitioned smoothly into
focused study.
Block 2 — Yoga
Initial stiffness faded; afterward, I studied longer without fidgeting.
Block 3 — Walk
Craving for the phone faded after 5 minutes. New capstone ideas surfaced naturally. Returned
refreshed.

Overall: The most reliable trigger for sitting down to work was environment prep—phone
outside, objective written, playlist on. These reduced the friction to
start work quickly.
