The past few weeks have felt like a reset for me creatively. Coming back from Cancun, I
noticed how much a change of environment a ects the way I approach writing. The trip
gave me space to breathe and I want to create again. My creative schedule isn’t perfectly
consistent yet, but I’ve started to see it less as a rigid plan and more as a rhythm. Some
days are for generating ideas, others just for noticing things. Having creative practice has
helped me become more aware of my thoughts and emotions instead of trying to ignore
them. It’s strange how discipline and creativity start to blend when you show up often
enough, even if the results aren’t always predictable.

What is the story or inspiration behind your work of art?

My artwork was inspired by the idea of space and how it mirrors the endless reach of
imagination and emotion. I wanted to Invision that feeling of floating between thoughts, like
drifting through an endless colorful void of space. Each glowing orb represents a different
emotion or idea, suspended in a dark, limitless background.

I chose Microsoft Paint as my medium because of its ease of use and simplicity, which
allowed me to show more expression. Painting’s basic tools made me more intentional with
how I used color and placement, allowing me to be more creative with each stroke.

​ y creative routine has been a mix of consistency and chaos lately, which honestly fits the​
M
​theme of this project. I’ve been trying to stay creative each week, whether that’s writing,​
 ​freestyling, or sketching out ideas. Some weeks, I hit a flow easily; other weeks, I’m just trying to​
  ​make time between school and work. Even when I’m tired, I’ve learned that doing something​
   ​small — like jotting down a rhyme or beat idea — helps keep my creativity alive. It’s less about​
    ​being perfect and more about staying in motion.​

​Project Experience:​

​ orking on this project was actually a lot of fun. I wanted my “worst song” to sound like a real​
W
​song that just went a little off the rails — something funny, chaotic, and confident. Once I started​

INT. BEDROOM – NIGHT

A dimly lit room. The glow of a monitor flickers across a desk littered with empty cans,
tangled cords, and a half-finished homework sheet.

ETHAN (17) sits hunched over the keyboard, eyes locked on the screen. Minecraft runs in
windowed mode — his character is building something high above the clouds.

ON SCREEN:
A massive floating castle made of stone and glass towers over the void. Ethan’s avatar,
wearing a diamond helmet, places the final block.

                 ETHAN
          There. Perfect.

He leans back. The faint click of the mouse echoes in the silence.

                 MOM (O.S.)
          Lights out soon, Ethan. You’ve got school.
