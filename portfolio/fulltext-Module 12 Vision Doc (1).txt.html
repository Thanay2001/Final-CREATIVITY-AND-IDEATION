Vision

I want to become a lead game developer and creative technologist who builds narrative-
driven, emotionally resonant, and technically impressive interactive experiences. My dream
is to create games that merge storytelling, design, and immersive technology—projects that
inspire people, spark imagination, and leave a lasting impact. Long-term, I want to found or
co-create a studio known for innovation, player-centered design, and heartfelt
worldbuilding.



Role Model — Hideo Kojima (Game Director, Designer, Creative Visionary)

Where he grew up: Born in Setagaya, Tokyo and raised in Osaka, Kojima spent his childhood
devouring books, films, and television—developing a love for narrative and worldbuilding
early on.

Education: He studied economics at Tokyo’s Keio University, but spent his free time writing
stories, making short films, and dreaming of game creation. He didn’t receive formal game-
design education—he built his skills through curiosity, persistence, and self-driven
creativity.

Influences: Cinema (especially Western film), literature, photography, and his personal
experiences with loneliness and imagination. Directors like Kubrick and novelists like
Gabriel García Márquez shaped his storytelling style.

Big Break: Kojima joined Konami in the 1980s, where he eventually pitched Metal Gear. His
breakthrough came with Metal Gear Solid (1998), which changed narrative games forever.

Why he inspires me: He proves that creativity isn’t limited by medium—games can be art.
He blends technology, storytelling, and emotion with fearlessness. He built an entire studio
based on a vision, and his willingness to innovate—even when doubted—shows me the
power of staying committed to your ideas.



Place

I want to pursue this dream in Cincinnati while I build my foundation, and eventually
transition to a larger creative tech hub such as Seattle, Los Angeles, or Tokyo, where game
studios and experimental tech companies thrive. My long-term goal is to work in a space
that values innovation, narrative design, and multidisciplinary creativity.
Entry Point — Path Toward the Dream

Goal: Begin as a Game Developer or Software Engineer at a studio known for strong
narratives or inventive mechanics.



Tactics:

• Build a polished portfolio including:

 - A narrative-driven indie game prototype

 - A polished web-based game (e.g., Drip Drop)

 - A systems-heavy project that showcases engineering skill

• Submit my work to indie game showcases (IGF, itch.io festivals, student competitions).

• Apply for internships or junior roles at studios such as Nintendo, Bungie, Naughty Dog,
indie studios, or Cincinnati-based creative tech companies.

• Strengthen network through LinkedIn, GDC talks, Discord dev communities, and local
Cincinnati game dev meetups.

• Collaborate with peers at UC on cross-disciplinary creative projects—blending software
dev, art, and storytelling.

• Continue building technical depth: Unity, Unreal Engine, gameplay systems, AI behavior,
networking, shader programming, and full-stack development.



Possible Creative Community to Connect With

• Cincinnati Game Dev Meetup (CincyIGDA)

• UC Game Development Club

• Global Game Jam + local hackathons

• Indie dev Discord communities
