PEER FEEDBACK RESPONSES

Response to Elliot's Silly Face 2-1 (module 9)

Your photo looks really cool and creepy in a good way. The red glass mask gives off a strong
horror feeling right away, and the way it warps the face underneath makes the image interesting
to stare at. It definitely matches the vibe of the horror movies you mentioned. The reflections in
the glass add a nice touch, too. Your explanation makes the image even better because it
connects the horror style to how you think about perception and identity. If you wanted to
explore this more, you could try different angles or lighting to show even more distortion or
contrast. But even as it is, the photo is eye-catching and has a clear message. Really strong
work.
