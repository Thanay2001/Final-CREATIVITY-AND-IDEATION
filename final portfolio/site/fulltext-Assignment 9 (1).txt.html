What is the story or inspiration behind your work of art?

My artwork was inspired by the idea of space and how it mirrors the endless reach of
imagination and emotion. I wanted to Invision that feeling of floating between thoughts, like
drifting through an endless colorful void of space. Each glowing orb represents a different
emotion or idea, suspended in a dark, limitless background.

I chose Microsoft Paint as my medium because of its ease of use and simplicity, which
allowed me to show more expression. Painting’s basic tools made me more intentional with
how I used color and placement, allowing me to be more creative with each stroke.



2. What was your experience with this assignment?

Creating this piece felt like exploring my own inner galaxy. At first, I didn’t have a clear plan
and just started experimenting with color and glow effects. But as the piece came together, I
realized it was less about designing something perfect and more about expressing how it
feels to be full of ideas and emotions that float and overlap.

I came to life during the layering process, watching colors blend and swirl like stardust. The
resistance came from not overthinking; I had to trust the process. My biggest insight was
that imagination doesn’t need to be structured and sometimes letting go of control allows
art to find its own form.
3. Tracy Taylor talked about working in seasons. Does that idea of a creative routine
resonate with you?

Yes, I relate to that. My creativity moves in waves, like the shifting orbits of planets. Some
days I’m full of energy and ideas, and other times I just need quiet or rest. Both are part of
my process.

What’s working is giving myself the freedom to create based on emotion instead of
deadlines. What’s not working is staying consistent when I get too focused on other
responsibilities. But this project reminded me that creativity doesn’t have to be constant, it
just must be honest. Every time I create something, even a small piece, it adds to the larger
picture of who I am as an artist.
