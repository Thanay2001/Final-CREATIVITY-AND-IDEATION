• Orange interior stitching and rubberized textures



Functional Overview:

• Dynamic Torque Vectoring AWD

• Multi‑Terrain Select (Mud/Sand, Rock/Dirt, Snow)

• 2.5L 4‑cylinder engine

• 8-inch touchscreen with wired Apple CarPlay

• Large cargo capacity

• Roof rails and higher ground clearance

User Research — Interview Questions & Responses
Interviewee: My Brother, Andrew Than, who drives a 2019 RAV4 Adventure

1. What do you like about the 2019 RAV4 Adventure?

“I love how tough it looks. The AWD feels great in the snow, and the orange interior stitching
looks really clean. The cargo space is good too.”
2. What do you NOT like about it?

“The engine gets really loud when accelerating. The screen sometimes lags. The interior plastic
scratches super easily. The ride can be stiff.”



3. What would you change?

“I’d want a quieter engine, faster touchscreen, wireless CarPlay, and better headlights at night.”

Reflection
My experience with this assignment was interesting because I currently drive this car and had an
overall good experience with the car. Instead of making something expressive, I focused on
possible improvements, based on my brother's feedback and my own. It felt more structured than
purely artistic work, but also more rewarding because the improvements had a clear purpose.



The process felt different from the artistic impulse to create. Artistic creativity feels emotional
and open-ended, while this project felt analytical and almost like engineering. Still, both rely on
imagination, just directed in different ways. I enjoyed both approaches, but designing solutions
felt especially satisfying because it had a clear goal: improving the user’s experience.
