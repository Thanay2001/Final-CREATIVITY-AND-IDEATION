​Creative Routine:​

​ y creative routine has been a mix of consistency and chaos lately, which honestly fits the​
M
​theme of this project. I’ve been trying to stay creative each week, whether that’s writing,​
 ​freestyling, or sketching out ideas. Some weeks, I hit a flow easily; other weeks, I’m just trying to​
  ​make time between school and work. Even when I’m tired, I’ve learned that doing something​
   ​small — like jotting down a rhyme or beat idea — helps keep my creativity alive. It’s less about​
    ​being perfect and more about staying in motion.​

​Project Experience:​

​ orking on this project was actually a lot of fun. I wanted my “worst song” to sound like a real​
W
​song that just went a little off the rails — something funny, chaotic, and confident. Once I started​
 ​writing “Spilled My Coffee,” I leaned into humor and relatability instead of worrying about how​
  ​“good” it sounded. Performing it was awkward at first, but once I started moving and rapping, it​
   ​turned into pure fun. The fear of looking silly disappeared when I remembered the point was to​
    ​create without judgment. I laughed at my mistakes and kept going, and that made it one of the​
     ​most enjoyable assignments so far.​
