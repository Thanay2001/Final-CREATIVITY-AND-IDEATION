Reflection Questions
1. Have you been able to stick to your creative routine? If not, what obstacles have prevented
you from keeping your schedule?

I’ve been doing decent with my creative routine, even though balancing school, work, and
projects can make it challenging. I’ve been feeling less motivated when things get busy, but I’ve
been still finishing my assignments and projects on time currently. Right now, I’m excited
because I’m getting ready for a trip to Cancun, and that excitement has actually helped spark
more creative energy. I hope thus can carry on some enthusiasm into my work and projects for
the rest of the semester.

2. What was your experience working on this project? Did you have fun? Were you able to
embrace the unknown and build in the moment?

I had a lot of fun making this monologue. At first, I tried to plan using a script of what I would
say, but once the camera started rolling, I just went with the flow. Acting out Quang’s
desperation while staying lighthearted made me laugh during filming. Embracing the unknown
performed a natural rhythm and made it feel more authentic than if I had memorized a script.

3. Was there anything that came out of the monologue that surprised you?

What surprised me most was how easily the humor came out once I committed to the character.
I didn’t expect to end up kneeling or bringing up Pokémon cards (packs), but those spontaneous
choices ended up being the funniest parts. It showed me that sometimes the best creative
moments come from reacting honestly to a situation instead of overthinking it.
