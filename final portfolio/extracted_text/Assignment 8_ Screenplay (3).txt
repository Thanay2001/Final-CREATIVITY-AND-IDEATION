Reﬂection: Creative Schedule and Screenplay Experience


The past few weeks have felt like a reset for me creatively. Coming back from Cancun, I
noticed how much a change of environment a ects the way I approach writing. The trip
gave me space to breathe and I want to create again. My creative schedule isn’t perfectly
consistent yet, but I’ve started to see it less as a rigid plan and more as a rhythm. Some
days are for generating ideas, others just for noticing things. Having creative practice has
helped me become more aware of my thoughts and emotions instead of trying to ignore
them. It’s strange how discipline and creativity start to blend when you show up often
enough, even if the results aren’t always predictable.

Writing the screenplay for this assignment, “Last Block,” was surprisingly grounding. At
ﬁrst, I resisted the idea of making it personal. I didn’t want it to be about me; I wanted it to
just be about someone playing a game. But as I kept writing, the story naturally became
about connection, memory, and ﬁnding comfort in something familiar. The moment where
the character ﬁnds the pickaxe left by his father felt like a turning point, not just in the story
but in the writing process too. It reminded me why I write: to make sense of things we don’t
always say out loud.

There was resistance in sitting down to ﬁnish it, the same kind of quiet dread that comes
with facing your own emotions. But once I leaned into that feeling, the words came more
easily. The scene let me express a quiet type of nostalgia I’ve been carrying since coming
back from vacation.
