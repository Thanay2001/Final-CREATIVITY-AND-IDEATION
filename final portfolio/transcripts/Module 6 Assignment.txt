yeah new day new disaster that's five for coffee on my shirt that's a pain
later again get out in the rain bones at two I missed the train laugh it off
can't kill my brain drop my keys then kick my shoe talk to myself who are you
the neighbors there I strike up posts coffee inside while chaos grows I move
fast the world's in spin every else how I win
missy days that's where I thrive
