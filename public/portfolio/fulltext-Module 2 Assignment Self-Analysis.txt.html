A life-defining moment for me happened during my band experience in high
school. Music had always been part of my life while growing up and had
affected me in small ways, but it wasn’t until high school band that I
realized how much music impacted me. The moment I think back to most
often happened during a class rehearsal for the state assessment.
Everyone was tired, our sound was off, and our director stopped us
mid-piece because we were flat and off beat. Instead of scolding us, he
said something simple: “Play what you can; we can fix it later.”

At first, it sounded like the usual lecture. But it was calmer and
honest. I picked up my sticks again and felt at ease. I wasn’t just
keeping time or playing rhythms; I was part of something bigger. The
music was not about perfection. It was about working on what we can
improve on individually and putting everything we practiced together.
For the first time, I understood that what I was passionate about was
not simply being in the band. It was the discipline of making something
feel alive with a group of different people.

Before that rehearsal, I had always felt embarrassed and ashamed when
making a mistake or missing a note during rehearsal. As a percussionist,
errors are a lot more obvious, and I didn’t want to be the reason that
dragged the class down a grade during assessment. That mindset made me
cautious, and I often played with less confidence. After our director
told us to just play, I realized that being so worried about errors was
stopping me from improving. Playing with more confidence, even if it
meant mistakes, actually made the group sound stronger and helped me
improve as a musician and a percussionist.

This connects directly to something Sir Ken Robinson said in his talk
“Do Schools Kill Creativity?” He explained that if people are not
prepared to be wrong, they will never come up with anything original.
What he meant applies perfectly to that moment in the band. If I only
focused on being correct all the time, I would never learn new skills or
grow as a player. Allowing myself to risk being wrong opened the door to
playing with more energy and focus.

That lesson became important beyond music. In my IT coursework, I often
face problems where there isn’t one clear solution right away. Whether
it’s debugging code or designing a system, it is easy to get stuck
worrying about making a mistake. Remembering that rehearsal helps me
approach problems with less fear. Instead of waiting for the “perfect”
answer, I try different approaches, test them, and adjust. That process
almost always leads to a better outcome.

Looking back, the rehearsal was more than just preparation for the state
assessment. It was the moment I learned the importance of improvement
that comes from trying, failing, and adjusting. That mindset shaped how
I work today, both in music and in IT.
