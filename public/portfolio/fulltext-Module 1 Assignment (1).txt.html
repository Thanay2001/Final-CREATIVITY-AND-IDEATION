You are starting your second week in this creative journey. Although this may feel stressful, and
even though this class is a requirement, try to have fun with it. Diving deeper into Creativity &
Ideation can help with different ways of thinking, helping us generate ideas and solutions that
will help in our future career. Think back on our past projects, coding a game, building a
website, and experimenting with design. Those moments were never just about the finished
product; they were about discovery and growth.

Rilke said: “Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it
has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart.” For us, it’s less about writing and more
about asking: what can I make or do? To keep us more curious, notice things, and keep playing
around with ideas. Even tech projects can feel like art when you put your own imagination into
them.

Rilke also said: “Be patient with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the
questions themselves… Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without
even noticing it, live your way into the answer.” There will be times when ideas feel weak or not
worth much. That is normal. You do not need all the answers right away. What matters is staying
with the process, whether it is code, sketches, writing, or design.

This semester, your focus is to expand your creative toolkit and try new ways of making things.
Just as important, you want to practice patience, letting ideas grow instead of forcing them. By
the end, the goal is not just a portfolio. It is being able to look back and see real progress in how
you think and create.

Inspiration will not always show up in big, dramatic ways. It is in small things: a phrase you
overhear, a pattern you notice, or even a color that stands out. Pay attention to those details
and use them.

Most of all, treat this class as a chance to build your creative habits. It is not just about grades or
deadlines. It is about finding approaches that will help you long after this course is done.
